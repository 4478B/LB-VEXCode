<img src="/api/placeholder/800/400" alt="Robot Overview" />

## Robot Overview
Our robot for the 2024-2025 VEX High Stakes season features an innovative through-bot intake system optimized for efficient scoring. Key features include:

### Mechanical Specifications
- Integrated through-bot intake system with direct mobile goal scoring capability
- Precision arm mechanism for wall stake scoring
- Advanced clamp mechanism for mobile goal control
- Strategic 6-motor configuration with specialized half-motor implementation for arm stability

### Motor Configuration
- **Drivetrain**: Primary motor group
- **Arm System**: Half-motor configuration for improved force distribution and skip prevention
- **Intake System**: Optimized for both ring collection and direct scoring

## Technical Implementation

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── auton.cpp        # Autonomous routines
├── devices.cpp      # Device configurations
├── main.cpp         # Primary control flow
├── movement.cpp     # Movement algorithms
└── headers/         # Associated header files
```

### Key Features
- Custom PID tuning system
- Odometry implementation (in development)
- Distance sensor integration for intake optimization
- Specialized control groups for precise movement

### Autonomous Routines
- AWP (Alliance Win Point) routines for both:
  - Goal side
  - Ring side
- Goal rush autonomous program for goal side

## Competition Strategy
Our team focuses on:
- Maintaining control of goals in the positive corner
- Late-game wall stake scoring
- Strategic mobile goal manipulation

### Achievements
- Excellence Award - SAINTS V5RC Competition

## Development Guidelines

### Code Management
- Private repository with controlled access
- Feature-based branch management
- Regular testing and validation cycles

### Best Practices
- Maintain established file structure
- Comprehensive commenting for new implementations
- Modular feature development in separate files
- Extensive route testing pre-competition
- Regular PID optimization using 3D tuner or manual configuration

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone repository
2. Verify device configuration matches team setup
3. Deploy to robot
   - Note: Configuration-specific functionality requires matching device setup
